  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    I’m an Information Systems student at The Ohio State University.
    I work on products and platforms where accuracy matters and
    decisions have real consequences.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most of my experience has been with internal systems, public-facing
    research sites, and compliance-heavy processes. I’m comfortable
    working with constraints and figuring things out as I go.
  </p>

  <p>
    I care about clear thinking, writing things down, and shipping work
    that actually helps people instead of getting in their way.
  </p>

  <h2>Outside of work</h2>
  <p>
    Outside of projects, I’ve taken on leadership roles focused on
    communication and coordination. I enjoy mentoring, breaking down
    messy problems, and improving systems that already exist rather
    than starting from scratch.

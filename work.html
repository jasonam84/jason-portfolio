      workflows, and data-heavy systems.

      If you only read one thing, start with Imageomics. It shows how I
      think about ownership, tradeoffs, and long-term maintenance.

    <p class="case-summary">
      I redesigned an internal website that researchers and staff rely on
      day to day. The goal wasn’t a new look. It was to make the system
      easier to understand, easier to trust, and easier to maintain.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reworked the information structure for a multi-team research institute</li>
      <li>Built and shipped the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
      <li>Cut down the time staff spent hunting for documents by about 30%</li>
      <li>Simplified approval steps, reducing turnaround time by roughly 40%</li>
      <li>Iterated based on feedback from real users, not assumptions</li>

  <!-- SUMMARY -->
  <section class="reveal">
    <h1>Asphalt QC/QA workflow support</h1>
    <p class="case-meta">
      Materials & Process Support · Ohio Department of Transportation · 2025
    </p>

    <p>
      This case covers my work supporting asphalt quality control and approval
      processes during the construction season at Ohio DOT.
    </p>

    <p>
      The work wasn’t about building software or redesigning a system from
      scratch. It was about operating inside an existing, regulated process
      and helping it run more consistently under real pressure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <section class="reveal">
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      I worked as an Asphalt Intern in the AASHTO-accredited Asphalt Materials
      Section. The section supports Ohio DOT projects by testing materials,
      reviewing mix designs, and approving asphalt used on active construction
      jobs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The work directly supported project contract administration, supplier
      certification, and the state’s asphalt QC/QA program. Accuracy mattered.
      Mistakes showed up later in audits or in the field.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ROLE -->
  <section class="reveal">
    <h2>My role</h2>

    <p>
      I supported both the Asphalt Mix and Asphalt Binder areas during the
      construction season. Most days involved verifying materials and mix
      designs submitted for Ohio DOT projects.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Tested asphalt binders and emulsions from active construction projects</li>
      <li>Recreated mix designs by mixing and compacting lab specimens</li>
      <li>Checked moisture susceptibility and other required performance criteria</li>
      <li>Reviewed new mix designs to confirm they met ODOT specifications</li>
      <li>Helped benchmark mix designs as part of balanced mix design work</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The job required careful documentation and consistency. Most issues
      weren’t dramatic. They were small mismatches that could slow approvals
      or create problems later if missed.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- PROBLEM -->
  <section class="reveal">
    <h2>What made the work challenging</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>High volume during peak construction months</li>
      <li>Strict specifications with little room for interpretation</li>
      <li>Multiple stakeholders relying on timely approvals</li>
      <li>Manual tracking across documents and spreadsheets</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- CONTRIBUTION -->
  <section class="reveal">
    <h2>How I contributed</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond testing and review, I helped bring more structure to how issues
      were tracked and discussed during reviews.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Identified recurring issues across mix design submissions</li>
      <li>Helped organize review notes so patterns were easier to spot</li>
      <li>Supported clearer handoffs between review and approval steps</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- IMPACT -->
  <section class="reveal">
    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fewer repeated clarification requests during reviews</li>
      <li>More predictable turnaround on mix design approvals</li>
      <li>Better preparation for audits and documentation checks</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- TRADEOFFS -->
  <section class="reveal">
    <h2>Tradeoffs</h2>
    <p>
      The work stayed intentionally conservative. Introducing new tools or
      processes would have added training overhead during the busiest part
      of the season.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- REFLECTION -->
  <section class="reveal">
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Working inside a regulated QC/QA system reinforced how important
      consistency and documentation are. Small process improvements often
      matter more than new technology.
